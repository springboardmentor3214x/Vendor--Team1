# Vendor Reliability Intelligence Platform - Frontend

Angular client for the Vendor Reliability Intelligence and Procurement Risk
Management Platform. It covers vendor onboarding, procurement workflows,
contract tracking, performance dashboards and reporting for six user roles.

## Tech stack

- Angular with standalone components
- Angular Material and Bootstrap for layout
- RxJS for state and HTTP composition
- Chart.js for dashboard visualisations

## Getting started

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The dev server runs on http://localhost:4200 and proxies API calls to the
FastAPI backend. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `BACKEND_URL` before
starting if the backend is not on the default port.
